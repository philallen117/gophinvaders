Now it is time for Invaders.

Here are some configuration constants expressed in Python. Translate them into Go and append them to cmd/gophinvaders/config.go following the same convention.

INVADER_WIDTH = 40
INVADER_HEIGHT = 30
INVADER_SPEED_X = 5
INVADER_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)  # Red
INVADER_ROWS = 5
INVADER_COLS = 11
INVADER_START_X = 100
INVADER_START_Y = 50
INVADER_SPACING_X = 60
INVADER_SPACING_Y = 40
INVADER_MOVE_DELAY = 30  # frames
INVADER_DROP_DISTANCE = 20
INVADER_SHOOT_DELAY = 60  # frames
INVADER_SHOOT_CHANCE = 5  # percent chance per delay interval per live invader

Invaders's width, height and color etc. are controlled by configuration constants, which have already been added to config.

Each invader also has an instance variable called `alive`, which is initially `true`. Only `alive` Invaders are displayed and participate further in the game.

Create a struct to represent an Invader with a draw method.

Make it support the Rectangler interface.

---

When the game starts, there is a grid of Invaders on the screen of dimensions invaderRows by invaderCols, with layout described by invaderStartY, invaderStartY, invaderSpacingX, invaderSpacingY.

Extend the code setting up the game's state to include this grid and to the game loop for drawing invaders.

---

i cannot see a test to ensure invaders are created Alive.

---

Invaders are not reused. Once they are killed, they play no further part in game. Suggest a changed design that uses a different data structure for holding the invaders and does not require an Alive flag in the Invader struct.

---

just some tidying up - remove "hello enbiten" from drawing

--- break for commit

Now for invader movement. Invaders move all together. They move horizontally every INVADER_MOVE_DELAY frames, by INVADER_SPEED_X pixels. Initially their `direction` (part of the game state) is positive, that is to the right.

When any Invader in Game.Invaders reaches the edge of the screen

- The entire set of Invaders drops down the screen by INVADER_DROP_DISTANCE
- Their collective `direction` swaps sign, that is toggles between left and right.

Add support for Invader movement to the code.
