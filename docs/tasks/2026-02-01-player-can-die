Now add collision logic player with invader bullet.

First, add an instance variable called game_lost to game, initially false.

If an invader bullet collides with the Player object, the game is lost. I prefer the update of dead invaders and player score to be done before the update of game_lost. Update the game logic and tests accordingly. We will deal with displaying the final outcome later.

As soon as the game is lost, we need to display a different scene with text that reads (taking an example score of 170).

Game over
Score: 170

The text lines should be centred and their font size should be.

Just to clarify, once game is lost, game objects should no longer be moved or updated.

Plan the changes and tests for them.

I notice the window title of the game still reads "hello ebiten". Change that to "gophinvaders".
