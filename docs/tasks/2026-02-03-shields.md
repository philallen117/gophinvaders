Time to incorporate shields into the game.

First, translate the following constants in Go and append them to cmd/gophinvaders/config.go, converting sizes from int to float 32.

```python
# Shield settings
SHIELD_WIDTH = 80
SHIELD_HEIGHT = 60
SHIELD_COLOR = (0, 255, 255)  # Cyan
SHIELD_START_COUNT = 4
SHIELD_START_X = 150
SHIELD_SPACING_X = 150
SHIELD_START_Y = 450
SHIELD_INITIAL_HEALTH = 10  # Number of hits shield can take before being destroyed
SHIELD_ALPHA_REDUCTION = 20  # Alpha reduction per hit (makes shields more visible)
```

- Shields display as rectangles with dimensions and color as specified in config.
- Shields do not move.
- Initially in the game state, there is a row of shields spaced out as specified by config.

First, construct a shield class, initialize game state and incorporate drawing shields into the game. We will deal with collisions later.

---

Add testing for the Shield class and update dates for initializing the game.

Invader bullets interact with shields. This also affects how shields are displayed.

- Shields are created with a `health` of SHIELD_INITIAL_HEALTH.
- When an invader bullet collides with a shield, the bullet becomes inactive, and the health of the shield is reduced by one.
- If the health is thus reduced to zero, the shield is destroyed and no longer interferes with invader bullets.
- The health of tbe bullet is represented on the screen with the alpha value of the filled rectangle; the alpha is `shield.health / SHIELD_INITIAL_HEALTH`. But I think you have done that part?

Plan these changes and their tests.

Finally, player bullets damage (and may destroy) shields, too. Plan the implementation and the tests.
