Create an interface Rectangler with one method Rectangle() which is intended to return a 4-tuple of left_x, top_y, width depth.

---

Now make Player, PlayerBullet and InvaderBullet implement this interface and write unit tests for them.

--

main.go is getting rather long. Please move Player, PlayerBullet and InvaderBullet into their own files, and refactor test files accordingly.
